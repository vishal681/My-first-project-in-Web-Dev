                the learning in daily life and in the future. The knowledge and
                information we acquire and attain outside the realm of books is what
                we called as education. Moreover, it comprises knowledge and experiences
                we learn in our homes, schools, and as members of society. Educating
                oneself helps change their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs. Eventually,

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India has undergone significant
                transformation in recent years. The government has taken several initiatives
                to improve the quality of education and increase access to education for all.
                Here are some ways in which education is transforming in India:</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Digitalization: The government of India has launched several digital
                initiatives to promote e-learning and digital education. Several educational
                institutions are offering online courses and have adopted technology-based 
                teaching methods.</p>
                
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Skill-based education: The education system in India is gradually shifting
                towards a skill-based approach. Many vocational training programs are being
                introduced to equip students with the necessary skills for the job market.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's grow togather</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India is a country that is rich in cultural
                diversity, heritage, and traditions. Despite this, one of the biggest 
                challenges that India faces today is the need for quality education for all.
                While the government has made significant strides in improving education in India,
                there is still a long way to go. However, the good news is that we can all work
                together to ensure that education in India continues to grow and flourish.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">    Education is one of the most important tools we have in our arsenal to create
                a brighter future for ourselves and for our country. By investing in education,
                we can empower the next generation to become leaders, innovators, and change-makers.
                This is why it is essential that we work together to create a strong and sustainable
                education system in India.</p>
